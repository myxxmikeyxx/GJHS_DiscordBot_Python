Before you start you need to have a [discord devloper account](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
You can start [here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/) for setting up a discord devloper account.

Generate a token for the bot and add it to the config.json

Install [python3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/) from here.
Next use pip3 to install discord.py. Install docs [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html)
